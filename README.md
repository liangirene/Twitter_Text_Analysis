This project aimed to analyze and gain insights from a large dataset of customer reviews. By leveraging data science techniques such as source analysis, sentiment analysis, and time series analysis, I aimed to understand customer sentiments, identify trends over time, and analyze the sources of the reviews.

## Source Analysis
To understand the sources of the customer reviews, I extracted information such as the platform or website from which the review was submitted. This allowed me to gain insights into where customers were expressing their opinions and evaluate the impact of different platforms on the overall sentiment.

## Sentiment Analysis
By employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, I analyzed the sentiment of each customer review. The objective was to categorize reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, providing a quantitative measure of customer satisfaction. I used popular NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy to preprocess the text, tokenize the reviews, and apply sentiment classification algorithms.

## Time Series Analysis
Understanding how customer sentiment changed over time was crucial for identifying trends and making informed decisions. I analyzed the temporal aspect of the data by performing time series analysis on the customer review dataset. This involved visualizing sentiment trends over different time periods, such as daily, weekly, or monthly intervals, to uncover patterns and fluctuations in customer opinions.
